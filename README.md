# WordSearch

The goal of this project is to solve word search puzzles using image processing.



The project is coded in Python 3 and uses *OpenCV* + *PyTesseract* to detect the grid and characters. The puzzle is then solved using a *fuzzy wuzzy search* in the grid to account for misrecognized characters.
